## :scroll: Description
This project, which was created as part of TheOdinProject's Foundations Course, is a web version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch where the assignment is to practice my skills in DOM manipulation and utilizing event listeners. This project allows users to freely draw on a canvas, adjust its pixel size, and change the brush color.


## :pencil2: Features
* A fully functional Etch-A-Sketch or sketchpad.
* Allows user to pick their desired color using a color picker.
* A rainbow brush that randomly choses a color whenever the user draws.
* An eraser tool to erase drawing.
* A reset button that erases the whole drawing.
* Able to toggle grid.
* Change the pixel size of canvas.
